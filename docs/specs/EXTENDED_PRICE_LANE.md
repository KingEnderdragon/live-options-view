# Extended price lane (#178): continuous collection and references

Issue: [#178](https://github.com/OwenTanzer/live-options-view/issues/178). The
lane extends the accepted 100-instrument price artifact beyond the QQQ/SPY
option-chain session. It is price-only work: option chains, the return scanner,
Tradier and trading keep their existing schedules.

## Architecture

`market_data/live_market/price_lane.py` runs one long-lived daemon thread,
started from `main()`. It owns:

- one tastytrade OAuth/DXLink connection with **price subscriptions only**
  (no option symbols are ever passed to `set_subscriptions`);
- the `intraday/prices.json` write, with `price_lane.writer_id` in the payload;
- `intraday/price_lane_health.json`, throttled to one write per 30 seconds and
  forced on failure;
- `intraday/price_references.json`, a bounded rolling-history companion.

`market_data/live_market/price_sessions.py` supplies the explicit per-family
session labels. `market_data/live_market/price_history.py` supplies the rolling
24-hour references. Neither module can start collection; they are pure
evaluation.

**One writer.** `runner.price_writer_plan()` is the only decision point.
`continuous_price_lane` starts the lane from `main()`; `in_session_legacy`
starts the old `prices_loop` inside `_run_session()`. The two paths cannot both
be selected, so a second publisher is not a configuration accident. The
artifact's `price_lane.writer_id` makes a foreign writer visible rather than
silent.

### Rollback

Set `PRICE_LANE_ENABLED=0` and redeploy the collector. The chain session
publishes prices again exactly as before. Off-hours equity/futures/crypto
coverage stops while the lane is disabled; there is no dual-writer fallback by
design. The lane does not change any option-chain setting, so rollback of this
feature is one environment variable.

## Supported sessions

| Family | Window (America/New_York) | Label |
|---|---|---|
| US equities/ETFs | 04:00–09:30, 09:30–16:00, 16:00–20:00 on NYSE trading days | `premarket`, `regular`, `afterhours` |
| Early closes | 13:00 on the verified dates in `EQUITY_EARLY_CLOSES` | `regular` then `afterhours`, `early_close: true` |
| CME energy/metals futures | Sunday 18:00–Friday 17:00, daily 17:00–18:00 break | `overnight`, `regular` inside 09:30–16:00, `maintenance` |
| Crypto | continuous | `continuous` |
| Spot FX | Sunday 17:00–Friday 17:00 | `overnight` |
| Daily series (Yahoo/Treasury) | retrieval, not a tick | `daily` |

Holidays come from the published exchange calendar; a non-trading weekday is
`holiday`, a weekend is `closed`. Calendar failure yields `unknown` and
`eligible: false` for equities — it never guesses an open market. Futures
holiday/early-close rules are an explicit table, not a weekday heuristic.

`market_data/live_market/price_sessions.py` is deliberately ET-wall-clock based,
so daylight saving changes move the UTC offset, not the 04:00/09:30/16:00/20:00
boundaries. `PriceLane` keeps its production clock in UTC for publication and
history, and converts each instant to ET before any calendar or session call.

Futures contracts are reconciled while the feed stays healthy. The lane
re-resolves on a bounded six-hour/ET-day cadence, compares the shared mapping
with its own subscription snapshot, and replaces only its own DXLink connection
when a roll or a chain-session resolution changes the active month. The payload
therefore names the contract the lane is actually subscribed to.

### Resolution integrity (November 9 repair)

The provider is the only authority for the active month, and a resolution
**gap is not a roll**. `resolve_futures()` builds a complete candidate mapping
off to the side and commits it atomically; a request that fails, returns no
items, or leaves a product without an eligible active contract preserves the
last good mapping and records a bounded retry (60 s doubling to 900 s). A
still-valid prior contract is carried for an unresolved product; an expired
prior is dropped rather than resubscribed.

The lane treats a snapshot that only *loses* contracts as a resolution gap: it
keeps its current subscriptions, records `contract_gap_reason` and
`contract_retry_at` in health, and retries on the bounded cadence. A replacement
feed is started before the old one is stopped, so a failed rebuild cannot leave
the lane with no subscriptions. Health now carries `contract_resolution`
(state, last error, retry, per-label symbols) alongside `contracts`.

The live November 9 failure this repairs: the 17:54:07Z six-hour reconciliation
produced a null mapping, the lane rebuilt onto it, and every futures row stayed
frozen at its 17:53:5xZ print for the rest of the evening while publication and
health stayed green.

## Provider capabilities and cadence

The November 9 bounded probe verified routes, not sustained entitlement:
82 of 89 probed symbols returned prices, including seven dated futures and three
crypto pairs. Extended-hours and weekend continuity remains a **deployment and
market-time observation**, not something fixtures can certify.

Bounds:

- publication every `PRICES_SECS` (10 s), unchanged;
- 82 price symbols × 4 event types = 328 DXLink subscriptions, one websocket;
  during the chain session this is a second connection alongside the option
  feed, not a replacement for it;
- OAuth access tokens refresh on their own lifetime; auth attempts are capped at
  four per hour window;
- failures back off 60 s, 120 s, 240 s … capped at 30 minutes;
- the rolling-reference object holds at most 150 ten-minute buckets per crypto
  instrument (three instruments, roughly 10 KB);
- lane health writes are throttled to 30 s.

## References

Every row keeps its existing `reference`. Additive fields are:

- `market_session`: the family session label above;
- `change_basis`: `rolling_24h`, `previous_close_unverified`,
  `prior_day_close_same_contract`, `contract_reference_unverified`,
  `dated_or_unknown`;
- `rolling_reference` and `rolling_change_pct`: crypto only.

A rolling reference is returned only when a ten-minute sample exists within
30 minutes of the 24-hour mark, for the same instrument. Before that, the value
is `null` and the comparison is unavailable — never 0% and never a prior UTC
day wearing a 24-hour label. Futures changes require the same resolved contract;
an unresolved or rolled contract cannot produce a comparison.

### Extended-session price basis (November 9 repair)

A last trade is a **current** equity price only when it carries a provider event
time inside the active session. During premarket and after-hours a trade that
predates the session (or has no provider time at all) is last session's close,
and publishing it while the venue trades is the defect Owen reported: the live
November 9 artifact carried the 15:59:59 ET closing print for all 71 streaming
equity rows across 2.7 hours of after-hours while two-sided quotes advanced.

In `premarket`/`afterhours` the selector therefore uses a **qualified two-sided
quote** as the price when the trade is not from the current session:

- both sides present and ordered, and both collector receipts inside
  `EXTENDED_QUOTE_MAX_AGE_SECS` (the feed stale window);
- spread at or under `EXTENDED_QUOTE_MAX_SPREAD_PCT` — a 13% after-hours quote
  (IGV) is a placeholder, not a price;
- `price_basis: bid_ask_midpoint`, `observed_at` from the **older** side's
  provider time only when both sides carry one; when the feed supplies none,
  `observed_at` stays `null` with `provider_quote_time_unavailable` and the row
  is **unknown**, never live. Receipt time is never promoted to observation
  time.

If no qualified quote exists, the stale close is retained rather than replaced.
Regular-session rows are unchanged, and futures/crypto/FX/daily families keep
their provider-timed or explicitly dated selection.

Provider evidence for the limit: this DXLink feed sends no extended-hours trade
prints for US equities (0 of 71 rows advanced past the closing print across
2.7 hours) and no `bidTime`/`askTime` on Quote events (QQQ's own 16:14 ET
chain-session provenance records both as null while receipts advance). The feed
health now counts events by type and counts quotes with/without provider time,
so a future deployment can state which of the two is missing instead of
inferring it. Fresh timestamped after-hours equity observations therefore need
a provider route that supplies extended trade prints or quote timestamps; that
is an owner decision, not something fixtures can manufacture.

## Verification

Offline: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_price_lane.py` covers
boundaries, holidays, early closes, DST, maintenance weekends, reconnect
backoff, auth budgets, chain isolation, rolling warm-up/persistence and payload
compatibility. `node --test market_mcp/overview-v2.test.js` covers the additive
consumer fields.

Deployment acceptance still requires observed automatic publications and
authenticated reads during premarket, after-hours, an overnight futures session
and a crypto weekend, plus reconnect/restart recovery. Record actual revisions,
timestamps and artifacts; local fixtures and off-session probes are not
sustained operational acceptance.

# Independent site releases and rollback (#225)

Current operating procedure after the November 12, 2026 cutover. The public
`live-options-view` Worker serves staged assets and forwards API/data requests
to `live-options-api`. The API owns accounts, execution, D1, operational R2
access and the sole settlement cron. Railway producers remain separate.

Cutover revision: `f759582e2b327989e31749ddfeae7df9c6474890`.
[API execution](https://github.com/OwenTanzer/live-options-view/actions/runs/43211318484)
and [asset execution](https://github.com/OwenTanzer/live-options-view/actions/runs/43212278203)
succeeded. Nova's implementation quest is closed; final normal-operation
acceptance remains on the strategy's checks page for November 12, 16:45 Pacific.
These receipts establish the cutover, not the result of that later check.

## Choose the release lane

| Change | Route | What stays running |
|---|---|---|
| HTML, CSS, browser JavaScript and packaged images | `deploy-staged.yml` | API and Railway producers |
| Gateway/policy or asset-build/configuration changes | Affected boundary review, then `deploy-staged.yml` | API and producers, provided contracts remain compatible |
| Backend handlers or API configuration | Separately reviewed `deploy.yml` API release | Asset version and producers |
| Producer code or shared Python packaging | Affected Railway producer release | Unrelated services; a producer restart creates a real capture gap |
| Schema, shared contracts or mixed changes | Explicit compatibility and ordering plan | Determined by the affected services |
| Markdown/docs only | No Cloudflare promotion needed | All Cloudflare services; check Railway watch scopes if prose is inside producer directories |

Both Cloudflare workflows are **manual dispatch only**, share concurrency group
`deploy-live-options-view`, require the protected `production` environment,
and query successful Web CI for the exact candidate. Cloudflare native Builds
were disabled at cutover. A merge alone does not publish the website.

**Do not run bare `wrangler deploy`.** Root `wrangler.toml` is the legacy
combined-Worker restoration configuration, retained for the explicit rollback
procedure below. It would replace the asset gateway with operational code.
`wrangler.assets.toml` uses a staged `payload/` layout and must not be deployed
directly from the source checkout either. Use the workflow.

## Ordinary site release during market hours

1. Review the complete change. Run `python tests/test_changed_paths.py` to
   identify affected services; mixed/producer changes are not site-only.
2. Commit the candidate and obtain successful Web CI for its full 40-character
   SHA. Record the current asset revision/version for rollback. For the first
   continuity canary use the existing #225 observation, not another study.
3. Dispatch the asset workflow at the current reviewed workflow ref, supplying
   the candidate SHA and `execute=true`. For example, from this repository:

   ```sh
   gh workflow run deploy-staged.yml --ref master -f revision=FULL_CANDIDATE_SHA -f execute=true
   ```

4. Approve that run's `production` environment deployment. The workflow builds
   and stages on its runner, verifies the API service exists, binds the exact
   revision/config/checks in its authorization, then rechecks under the release
   lock before deployment. Dry-run is the default when `execute` is omitted;
   a dry-run does not publish anything. No API release, migration, write fence,
   secret copy or producer restart is part of an ordinary asset release.
5. Read back the successful run/provider version and verify `/__environment`
   and `X-Asset-Revision` at https://options.moopertonic.net against the candidate.
   Check the changed feature and expected data/auth behavior. Preserve the API
   version, sole API cron and producer identities; inspect unexpected changes
   rather than restarting a collector to manufacture freshness.

The artifact contains allowed site assets plus the two frontend gateway/policy
modules. It excludes backend and producer code, credentials and Markdown prose.
The gateway has ASSETS/API bindings, explicit empty crons and no direct D1/R2/KV
binding. HTML is served with `no-store`. Static requests still invoke the
gateway (`run_worker_first=true`); no free-invocation or latency claim is made.
Browser API calls retain their same-origin URLs. Public archive reads on the
custom domain still use the fixed public R2 origin; `/browser-data/` retains its
workers.dev origin restriction. A custom-domain 403 from that proxy alone is
not evidence of a capture failure. The legacy `/r2-proxy/` is GET-only and uses
the bounded public-key policy, not arbitrary object access.

## Local preview and artifact inspection

Use Node 24 (Node 22 requires `--experimental-sqlite`) in an isolated clean
checkout. These checks and local preview do not contact production writers:

```sh
node --test tests/asset_boundary.test.mjs tests/preview_isolation.test.mjs tests/preview_transport.test.mjs tests/asset_rollback.test.mjs tests/preview_storage_boundary.test.mjs tests/deploy_sequencing.test.mjs
node scripts/preview-local.mjs
```

Preview uses localhost:8787, disposable SQLite/memory stores and fixture quotes
and public data. Use disposable credentials. Ctrl+C stops it; state disappears.
Hosted preview would need separate disposable resources and provider approval;
local emulation is not a provider-permission test.

For inspection, choose new OUT and STAGE directories outside the source and
outside each other, replacing all placeholders:

```sh
node scripts/build-assets.mjs --revision FULL_CANDIDATE_SHA --out OUT
node scripts/build-assets.mjs --verify OUT
node scripts/prepare-asset-release.mjs --artifact OUT --out STAGE
node scripts/prepare-asset-release.mjs --verify-stage STAGE
```

The CLI requires clean exact-HEAD source. Staging selects the applied root asset
config, refuses invalid/drifted source and records payload/config hashes. Stage
verification alone proves retained integrity, not permission or current-source
freshness. The deployment gate binds `config_root` and revalidates current
source, authorization and checks immediately before execution. Never edit an
old plan/hash to make a changed candidate pass. Historical proposal templates
under `patches/` are not ordinary release configurations.

## Website-only rollback

Use an accepted previous **separated asset** artifact with the current API/schema
contract. Verify old and current manifests, then stage the old against current:

```sh
node scripts/build-assets.mjs --verify OLD_ARTIFACT
node scripts/build-assets.mjs --verify CURRENT_ARTIFACT
node scripts/prepare-asset-release.mjs --artifact OLD_ARTIFACT --current CURRENT_ARTIFACT --out NEW_ROLLBACK_STAGE
node scripts/prepare-asset-release.mjs --verify-stage NEW_ROLLBACK_STAGE
```

Promote the old asset revision through the same protected asset lane after
compatibility review; for the workflow, Web CI must exist for that revision and
its build tooling must remain compatible. A retained-stage local promotion must
use the reviewed gate and applicable release authority. Verify the restored
asset revision and unchanged API/cron/producers. No schema, account, archive or
collector rollback belongs in a website-only rollback.

The API serving floor is D1-reading revision
`90cdc56c207ad0c733bb2f1b1bb15d995472bf47` or a reviewed compatible descendant.
Migration 0001/0002 hashes are in release.json; schema mismatch refuses rollback.
Never serve from stale archived KV. The first accepted separated asset baseline
is the cutover revision above; pre-split checkouts are not asset-only rollback
candidates.

### Combined Worker restoration (local procedure)

The combined Worker (wrangler.toml) is the transition rollback target, not an ordinary asset rollback. There is no rollback workflow: deploy-rollback.yml was removed in repair 2 (2026-11-11) because it could not transport its authorization artifact and its checkout followed the dispatch ref, not the restoration revision. Restoration is a bounded local procedure through the candidate gate script, with DEPLOY_REPO_ROOT pointing at a checkout of the recorded combined build (6c1051a7b4fcbc115551562b2eb531c13a440e2e, wrangler.toml SHA256 213c2e56a9f75cd0cdbce4e967022d12581cd711701f091cc6289214648eea72):

```
# 1. From the candidate checkout, run the reviewed gate script. Point
#    DEPLOY_REPO_ROOT at a checkout of the recorded combined build.
git worktree add /tmp/lov-rollback-restore 6c1051a7b4fcbc115551562b2eb531c13a440e2e
DEPLOY_REPO_ROOT=/tmp/lov-rollback-restore \
  node scripts/deploy-staged-payload.mjs --authorize --target rollback --revision 6c1051a7b4fcbc115551562b2eb531c13a440e2e --authorizer <name> --rollback-reason <reason>
# 2. Dry-run, then execute only under the same authorization:
DEPLOY_REPO_ROOT=/tmp/lov-rollback-restore \
  node scripts/deploy-staged-payload.mjs --deploy --target rollback --revision 6c1051a7b4fcbc115551562b2eb531c13a440e2e
```

The gate verifies the restoration checkout is the recorded combined build (its wrangler.toml hash must match the recorded SHA256), re-reads wrangler.toml before execution, and refuses on drift. It deploys ONLY wrangler.toml; it never re-deploys the candidate's asset or API config. The authorization record lives in the shared .deploy-releases directory (default sibling .deploy-releases), not in any workflow artifact — there is no artifact transport to supply. Proved by tests/deploy_sequencing.test.mjs ('Rollback: local candidate-script + DEPLOY_REPO_ROOT restores the recorded combined build').


Combined restoration is an exceptional topology reversal, requiring the approved
fence and reverse cron handoff. The commands above authorize and dry-run only;
execution adds `--execute` under that specific restoration authority. Prevent
duplicate settlement ownership and restore writes only after verification.
Ordinary site release does not repeat this one-time cutover procedure.

#### Reverse cron handoff: settlement weekdays must be MON-FRI

This section documents the procedure only. It authorizes no restoration and no
provider action; both still need the specific restoration authority above.

- **Preserved historical artifact (do not edit).** The pinned combined build
  6c1051a's `wrangler.toml` (SHA256 `213c2e56…eea72`) declares
  `crons = ["*/15 12-23 * * 1-5"]`. It stays byte-identical, because the gate
  refuses any restoration checkout whose hash differs. Likewise leave
  `patches/musef-225/*.proposed` and every recorded hash as history.
- **Why the pinned value is wrong live.** Cloudflare interpreted the numeric
  day-of-week `1-5` as Sunday–Thursday. The live API trigger was corrected to
  `*/15 12-23 * * MON-FRI` on 2026-11-14, and `wrangler.api.toml` matches it.
  Deploying the pinned config therefore installs the wrong weekdays unless the
  trigger is corrected as part of the handoff.
- **Intended restored live schedule.** Exactly one settlement cron in the
  account, `*/15 12-23 * * MON-FRI` (same UTC window and frequency), owned by
  the restored combined Worker `live-options-view`. The API Worker
  `live-options-api` then holds no cron.

During the reverse handoff:

1. Before executing, read back the triggers of both Workers and record them.
   Expected: `live-options-api` holds only `*/15 12-23 * * MON-FRI`, and
   `live-options-view` holds none.
2. Keep one owner at every step and never two. Clear the API Worker's trigger
   before the combined deploy installs its own. A brief interval with no owner
   only skips an idempotent 15-minute sweep. Two owners would run settlement
   twice.
3. After the combined deploy, read back `live-options-view`'s triggers. They
   will show the pinned numeric `1-5`. Correct them with a trigger-only change
   to exactly `*/15 12-23 * * MON-FRI`, under the same restoration authority.
   Do not change the restoration checkout to do this.
4. Verify and record, in the dated release record: exactly one settlement cron
   across both Workers, on `live-options-view`, with a named-weekday expression
   `*/15 12-23 * * MON-FRI`; `live-options-api` holds none. Stop and escalate if
   a numeric day-of-week remains or both Workers hold a cron.

Forward re-separation reverses this: the API Worker again becomes the only owner
of `*/15 12-23 * * MON-FRI` from `wrangler.api.toml`, and the asset Worker keeps
its explicit `crons = []`.

# Market snapshot collector

The collector acquires tastytrade/DXLink market data and publishes the QQQ/SPY
snapshots consumed by the website and Market MCP (Model Context Protocol).
Run `python -m collector` from the repository root;
[__main__.py](__main__.py) delegates to [runner.py](runner.py).
Railway service `live-options-view` uses that command, the
[shared Python image](../runtime/python/README.md), no cron and restart policy
`NEVER`. Build/start/watch settings are service-managed.
Crassus is a separate deployable with its own dependencies and strategy state.

## Follow the implementation

| Responsibility | Source |
|---|---|
| Session startup, threads and shutdown | [runner.py](runner.py), [sessions.py](sessions.py) |
| Read-only OAuth and token refresh | [oauth.py](oauth.py) |
| Streaming subscription and event ingestion | [feed.py](feed.py), [chain.py](chain.py) |
| Snapshot construction and underlying-market readings | [market.py](market.py) |
| Pure VWAP, RVOL and momentum calculations | [market_signals.py](market_signals.py) |
| Price publication and yfinance fallback | [prices.py](prices.py) |
| Process-local live-quote service | [quotes.py](quotes.py) |
| Restart state, health and weekly archives | [state.py](state.py), [health.py](health.py), [weekly.py](weekly.py) |
| Optional EIA forecast and vintage comparison | [steo.py](steo.py), [crude_calibration.py](crude_calibration.py) |

## What the outputs mean

- `intraday/latest.json` and `intraday/spy/latest.json` hold separate underlying
  snapshots. A missing SPY reading must not substitute QQQ. See the
  [SPY contract](../notes/specs/SPY_COLLECTION.md).
- Snapshot open interest is prior-day settled information. Volume and volume
  changes provide intraday activity; they do not measure newly opened positions.
- VWAP (volume-weighted average price) uses sampled underlying prices weighted by
  cumulative-volume changes. It is an approximation, not a trade-by-trade tape.
  RVOL (relative volume) compares cumulative session volume with historical
  readings in the same time bucket; insufficient history is an explicit state.
- Snapshot time, provider observation time and retrieval time are distinct.
  Partial-session and stale-data metadata affect how a reading should be used.
- Live bid/ask requests use the in-memory quote server through the Worker's
  `/api/live-quotes` route. That transport does not write an R2 object. Stored
  snapshots support other readings and recovery; they are not the live quote feed.
- Weekly archives produced here are separate from Historical's daily archive
  pipeline. Updating weekly manifest metadata does not advance its `dates` list.

Follow a displayed reading using the [walkthrough](../notes/WALKTHROUGH.md).
The [OAuth operations reference](../site/tastytrade-oauth.md) covers credential
provisioning; credentials do not belong in documentation or logs. Fixture checks
are inventoried in [Collector CI](../.github/workflows/collector-ci.yml).
Historical design details remain linked from [documentation history](../notes/HISTORY.md).

"""Monthly cost projection for the News pilot, from measured cycles (news_cycle_cost_measure.py).

    python tests/news_cost_projection.py MEASUREMENTS.json [--months 12] [--interval-min 15]

Everything printed is labelled OBSERVED (taken from the measurement file) or PROJECTED (arithmetic on
it plus the stated assumptions). Prices are the published list prices checked 2026-11-14 (Cloudflare
R2 Standard; Railway standard services) and are inputs here, not measurements. The R2 free tier is
account-wide and already shared with the market collectors, so it is NOT subtracted: these are
incremental costs as if no free allowance were left.

Model:
  * Per-cycle requests are the measured steady-state cycle (the last measured cycle) minus its
    listings of news/v1/runs/, which are then re-added from the growth law below.
  * news/v1/runs/ grows by RUN_OBJECTS_PER_CYCLE objects per cycle (measured: 4) and is listed in full
    RUN_LISTINGS_PER_CYCLE times per cycle (measured: 4), one ListObjectsV2 request per 1,000 keys.
    Nothing in the pilot deletes raw runs ("keep (immutable history)"), so this term grows every month.
  * Failure headroom: every request count is multiplied by FAILURE_FACTOR (a retried or failed cycle
    repeats work; a 412 is billed as Class A).
  * Compute: each cycle runs RUNTIME_S (projected: measured local wall time plus REQUEST_LATENCY_S per
    request, serial) at the measured peak memory and CPU_SHARE of a vCPU, billed per minute of use.

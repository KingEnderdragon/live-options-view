"""Build and publish #130 windows from local finalized day archives.

This is the producer-to-publisher link for live window products:

* It reads ONLY local day directories (the scanner host's spool, the same
  files ``finalize`` wrote: summary.json, universe.json,
  sweeps/manifest.jsonl, sweeps/sweep_NNNN.jsonl.gz). It never touches a
  provider and never reads R2.
* ``build_windows`` writes a local emit root (``oa203/windows/`` tree).
  ``publish_windows`` publishes an emit root — or, with ``window_ids``,
  exactly the windows one cycle built — to an injected backend.
  The CLI's ``windows-publish`` only offers the local-filesystem backend;
  R2 publication is a release step (Chej) via ``windows_publish.r2_backend``.
* The production hook is ``run_after_finalize`` (called from
  ``session.finalize``): it runs only when the env flag
  ``OA203_WINDOWS_LIVE_ENABLED == "1"`` (disabled by default). Enabling
  the flag is live activation (Chej alone, after review); the code only
  implements the hook.
* ``build_windows`` defaults to a bounded 50-underlying subset
  (``universe_scope: bounded_subset`` — always served partial, never
  final). ``full_universe=True`` loads the complete selected universe
  (at most 500 underlyings PER DAY — the cap is daily, not on the
  union: the per-day selected set may change day to day, so the union
  over the window may exceed 500; the union is bounded by 10 sessions
  x 500) and combines it before ranking (see ``windows_combine``); the
  passed underlyings must cover every selected underlying of every
  loaded day, or the build fails closed.

The loader reuses ``windows_replay.load_session`` exactly (same manifest,
calendar, row and contract-identity validation) by pointing its ``fetch``
at the local day directory for one call. That is the point: one
implementation of the validation, no fork. A final day assessed
``partial`` is admitted with explicit ``session_partial:<day>`` reasons
(see ``windows_replay.validate_manifest``); a torn or invalid manifest
is still refused fail-closed.

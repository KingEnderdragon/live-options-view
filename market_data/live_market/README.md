# Market snapshot collector

The collector acquires tastytrade/DXLink market data and publishes the QQQ/SPY
snapshots consumed by the website and Market MCP (Model Context Protocol).
Run `python -m market_data.live_market` from the repository root;
[__main__.py](__main__.py) delegates to [runner.py](runner.py).
Railway service `live-options-view` uses that command, the
[shared Python image](../../deployment/python/README.md), no cron and restart policy
`NEVER`. Build/start/watch settings are service-managed.
Crassus is a separate deployable with its own dependencies and strategy state.

## What the outputs mean

- `intraday/latest.json` and `intraday/spy/latest.json` hold separate underlying
  snapshots. A missing SPY reading must not substitute QQQ. See the
  [SPY contract](../../docs/specs/SPY_COLLECTION.md).
- Snapshot open interest is prior-day settled information. Volume and volume
  changes provide intraday activity; they do not measure newly opened positions.
- VWAP (volume-weighted average price) uses sampled underlying prices weighted by
  cumulative-volume changes. It is an approximation, not a trade-by-trade tape.
  RVOL (relative volume) compares cumulative session volume with historical
  readings in the same time bucket; insufficient history is an explicit state.
- Snapshot time, provider observation time and retrieval time are distinct.
  Partial-session and stale-data metadata affect how a reading should be used.
- Every archived `snapshot_*.csv` gets a durable sidecar
  `snapshot_*.provenance.json` (`snapshot_provenance.v1`) recording
  `constructed_at`, `archive_uploaded_at`, `latest_published_at`,
  `publication.status` (`published`, or `archived_unpublished` with a reason),
  the CSV object key/row/column counts, and the selected underlier's
  `price_basis`, `collector_received_at`, `provider_observed_at` (null when
  unknown), `freshness`, and contributing bid/ask/last times — including why a
  midpoint was rejected. The CSV keeps its existing columns; readers that only
  know the named values are unchanged, and a missing sidecar means unknown
  provenance. A midpoint is stamped with the *older* contributing side's
  receipt and only when both sides carry one, so a fresh ask cannot rejuvenate
  an older bid or an old last trade. Historical CSVs written before the
  sidecar have no recoverable per-price provenance and are not backfilled.
- Live bid/ask requests use the in-memory quote server through the Worker's
  `/api/live-quotes` route. That transport does not write an R2 object. Stored
  snapshots support other readings and recovery; they are not the live quote feed.
- Weekly archives produced here are separate from Historical's daily archive
  pipeline. Updating weekly manifest metadata does not advance its `dates` list.

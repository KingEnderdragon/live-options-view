"""Publish new, immutable per-underlying expiry marks; never rewrite archives.

Only a timed post-close observation on the expiry date qualifies. Early-close
sessions without such an observation remain pending, requiring a separately
verified mark rather than borrowing an intraday or different underlying price.

`observed_at` must be the PROVIDER's own event time for the price being
marked -- never the collector receipt time. A fresh receipt of a price
whose provider observation time is unknown, pre-close, stale, future, or
mixed across the two midpoint sides must stay pending; the publisher
rejects all of those (unknown/stale/future fail the window/freshness
checks, and a mixed midpoint is stamped with its older side, which is
pre-close). Callers pair the price with its provider time via
quotes._provider_observed_spy_price (Brian #184's
UnderlyingSelection.provider_observed_at model); a remembered/carried-
forward spot has no provider time and can never publish.

Taking the min (oldest) contributing leg proves the oldest leg isn't
stale, but hides a future newer leg: a valid bid at 21:00:30 plus a
FUTURE ask at 21:01:01 (now 21:00:40) would publish stamped 21:00:30.
So callers must validate EVERY contributing provider timestamp with
contributing_provider_times_valid before publishing; the publisher alone
only sees the one `observed_at` it is given.

"""Bounded one-shot launcher for the scheduled News pilot cycle.

    python -m market_data.news.launch --config market_data/news/deploy/news-pilot.json [pilot-cycle options]

The scheduler runs this, not `pilot-cycle` directly. `cycle_budget_s` bounds only the collection
phase; nothing bounds a cycle's views, research, publication, store calls, SDK retries or a hung
connection. This launcher gives the whole process one explicit wall-clock deadline, from its own
start, covering every phase, retry and subprocess of the cycle, and always ends with exactly one
terminal record on stdout and a definite exit code:

  1. It loads and validates the pilot config (`launcher` block included). An invalid config is a
     terminal failure before anything runs.
  2. It runs the cycle as a child process in its own process group (`--run-cycle`, below), which runs
     `python -m market_data.news pilot-cycle --config <config> <options>` in-process.
  3. At `deadline_s` it interrupts the child's whole group: the child raises CycleInterrupted (a
     BaseException), so the cycle's existing failure handling runs and its writer/publish leases are
     released by their context managers, exactly as on any other exception. Nothing new is written.
  4. If the group is still alive `interrupt_grace_s` later, it is killed. A killed cycle cannot release
     its leases: the record says so, and later cycles exit non-zero ("lease held") until the lease
     expires and an operator who has confirmed no writer runs passes --break-stale-lease
     (publish-status reports stale_*_lease). Nothing here breaks a lease.
  5. A SIGTERM/SIGINT to the launcher (a scheduler stop) starts the same interrupt-then-kill sequence.

`load_pilot_config` requires deadline_s + interrupt_grace_s + kill_wait_s < schedule.interval_s and
<= the lease TTL, so a launcher always exits before the next scheduled tick (no self-overlap) and a
live cycle never holds a lease past its expiry. Exit codes:

  0    the cycle finished and its own exit code was 0
  1/2  the cycle finished with that exit code (pilot-cycle's own failure codes)
  2    the config is invalid (no child is started)
  124  deadline: the cycle was interrupted and exited (its leases were released by the cycle)
  137  deadline or stop: the cycle did not exit within the grace; its group was killed and confirmed
       gone (leases may remain held)
  126  deadline or stop: the group was killed but its termination could NOT be confirmed within
       kill_wait_s (a writer may still be running; reported, never assumed away)
  143  stopped by a signal to the launcher; the cycle was interrupted and its group exited
  125  the child could not be started

"The cycle" is the child's whole owned process group (a new session): a leader that exits while a
descendant remains does not end the cycle; the launcher waits for the group under the same deadline.
Only an observed-empty group is reported as group_terminated: true.

# News pilot: runtime, operations, storage and cost envelope

Status: evidence for the schedule within Owen's **$5/month incremental** News budget (2026-11-14).
Revised after Chej's review of #247: the history read now lists raw runs only after the checkpoint
frontier (bounded listing). Nothing here is provisioned. The pilot config stays `active: false` and
the cadence stays `*/15`.

Each figure is labelled:
- **OBSERVED:** measured from the shipped code on local stores;
- **PROJECTED:** arithmetic on observed figures plus a stated assumption;
- **NEEDS PROVIDER ACCESS:** cannot be measured without the provisioned buckets or service.

## How it was measured

- `tests/news_cycle_cost_measure.py` runs `publish.pilot_cycle` with the shipped config, once per
  simulated 15-minute tick, against two counting local stores. Every store call is recorded as the R2
  request it maps to in `R2ObjectStore`:
  - put → PutObject (Class A);
  - list → ListObjectsV2 (Class A, one request per 1,000 keys returned);
  - get → GetObject (Class B);
  - `last_modified` → HeadObject (Class B);
  - delete → DeleteObject (free).
- `--expiry` simulates a verified store-clock bound in a temporary copy of the config. The shipped
  `clock_bound_verified` stays `false`.
- `tests/news_cost_projection.py` projects monthly figures from a measurement file. Its assumptions
  are in its docstring and below.
- `tests/test_news_checkpoint.py` `BoundedListing` measures the run listing on a 1,500-run history
  (6,000 raw objects, about 16 days at `*/15`).

## Observed

| Measure | Before (#247 head 832a6cb) | Now (bounded listing) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Class A per cycle, steady (192 cycles, expiry on) | 170 | 170 |
| Class B per cycle, steady | 231, plus one content replay a day (428 at 192 runs: 4 GETs per raw run) | 233, no replay spike (max 42 private) |
| Listings of `news/v1/runs/` per cycle | 4, each over the whole raw history | 4, each after the frontier only |
| Run keys listed per cycle, 1,500-run history | > 6,000 per listing | ≤ 16 in total (`BoundedListing`) |
| ListObjectsV2 for runs per cycle, 1,500 runs | ≥ 2 × 6 + … (grows) | constant over 10 further cycles |
| Scheduled verification (every 24 h) | content replay: every object read again | full listing compared with the checkpoint; re-reads only changed runs (0 normally) |
| Public objects held / deleted per cycle | 316 / 63 (free) | unchanged |
| Private growth per cycle with no new items | ~58 KB, 6 objects | unchanged |

- **Expiry off** (the shipped `clock_bound_verified: false`): nothing expires. The 6,300-page cap is
  reached after about 100 cycles (~25 h at `*/15`), and then publication pauses (96-cycle run). This is
  unchanged.
- **Live feeds** (2026-11-14, a Saturday, local stores, reads only):
  - All 4 sources were OK, with 82 items on first sight.
  - The feeds' own rates add up to about 35 items/day.
- **Process:** one fixture cycle under the launcher on Linux took 0.45 s with about 29 MB peak.
- **Local wall time is not runtime.** Its growth over many cycles is the local store's directory walk
  (`rglob` over directories left empty by deletes), which R2 does not have.

## Projected

Assumptions (in `tests/news_cost_projection.py`):
- **Prices** (list prices checked 2026-11-14):
  - R2 Standard: Class A $4.50/M, Class B $0.36/M, storage $0.015/GB-month; deletes and egress free.
  - Railway: $0.000463 per vCPU-minute, $0.000231 per GB-RAM-minute.
- **Free tier not subtracted.** It is account-wide and shared with the collectors.
- **Failure headroom:** ×1.25 on every request.
- **Runtime:** about 97 s per cycle (assumed 0.15 s per serial R2 request, plus 10 s for feeds).
- **Compute:** 0.5 vCPU and 0.1 GB while running.
- **Archive growth:** 35 items/day at 4 KB each.
- **Full listing:** 2 full listings of `news/v1/runs/` a day (the verifying read and its save), one
  request per 1,000 raw objects. This is the only growing term.

| Month | `*/15` Class A | `*/15` total | `*/30` total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 612 k | **$4.24** | $2.12 |
| 2 | 613 k | $4.25 | $2.13 |
| 3 | 614 k | $4.26 | $2.13 |
| 6 | 617 k | $4.28 | $2.14 |
| 12 | 622 k | $4.31 | $2.16 |

Breakdown at `*/15`, month 1:
- R2 $3.06: Class A $2.76, Class B $0.30, storage < $0.01.
- Railway $1.18.

The full listing's share of Class A is 0.1% in month 1 and 1.6% in month 12. Storage is about
0.18 GB after a month and about 2 GB after a year.

**Reading.**
- With the bounded listing, `*/15` is projected within $5 every month for the first year, with about
  $0.70 of headroom. The headroom rests on the assumed request latency and failure factor (both need
  provider data) and on no free-tier allowance.
- **Correction to the #247 projection.** It omitted the daily content replay, 4 GETs per raw run per
  day. That would have added about 4 M Class B a month (about $1.40) by month 12, on top of the
  listing growth it did show. The bounded design removes both growing terms.
- What still grows:
  - the daily full listing, linear and small;
  - stored bytes;
  - the checkpoint body's bytes, read and written once per cycle as one object each. The request
    counts stay the same; the transfer is free, and its time is part of the runtime assumption.

## Integrity schedule (changed by the bounded listing)

- **Every cycle:** runs after the frontier are listed and verified. A run that is not settled is never
  passed by the frontier, so it is listed every cycle. The head's `frontier_stopped_at` names it.
- **Before any upload at or before the frontier** (a recovered spool with an older run_id, or a clock
  that went backwards): the writer first clears the frontier durably. Covered by tests for recovery, a
  crash after the upload, a crash before it, and a backwards clock.
- **Every 24 h (writers):** a full listing compared run by run with the checkpoint. A rewritten run is
  re-read and fails visibly; a missing run fails visibly (`HistoryCorrupt`).
- **Trade-off:** a change to a run at or before the frontier is found within 24 h, not on the next
  read. `checkpoint compare` finds it at once. The full content replay now runs only when the
  checkpoint is missing, corrupt or incompatible, or on `checkpoint rebuild`.

## Retention cleanup (included above)

- Snapshots are capped at 3: 68 free deletes per cycle in the private store.
- Retired public incarnations are deleted after the reader grace once expiry is enabled: 63 free
  deletes per cycle.
- Raw runs, commit records and receipts are kept (immutable history, unchanged).

## Needs provider access (Chej's provider work)

1. R2 request latency from the scheduler host: it decides the real runtime and the Railway figure.
2. Current account R2 usage against the free tier.
3. Railway cron metering for a one-shot service, and its SIGTERM-to-SIGKILL grace on stop. The
   launcher's interrupt grace is 90 s.
4. The store-clock bound (`clock_bound_verified`).

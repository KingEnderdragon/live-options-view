"""History checkpoint: a disposable speed-up over full replay, never a second source of truth.

Full replay (archive.scan_history) reads and verifies every committed run on every read. The
checkpoint holds the verified contents of *settled* runs (manifest read back and commit.json
recorded), so a read lists the run prefix once, reads the checkpoint, and fully reads only:

  - runs not in the checkpoint (the tail: new, availability-pending, uncommitted or corrupt runs);
  - checkpointed runs whose listing changed: any object added, removed or rewritten (the listing's
    size and ETag locally size and mtime differ from the ones the run was verified against).

Layout (private store, outside news/v1/runs/, so the archive itself is never touched or pruned):

  news/v1/checkpoint/history/{sha256}.json.gz   content-addressed body (all checkpointed runs)
  news/v1/checkpoint/head.json                  pointer: key, bytes, sha256, run count, times

The body is written and read back before the head points at it; the current and previous bodies
are kept, so a reader that read the old head still finds its body. A crash between the two leaves
the old head (and an orphan body that the next save removes).

The checkpoint is used only when it is present, intact and compatible, and it is refused when it is
stale. Anything else falls back to full replay, which also rebuilds it on the next writer save:

  missing        no head
  corrupt        head or body unreadable, body missing, size/digest/shape mismatch
  incompatible   different checkpoint schema, readable manifest schemas, commit schema or objects
  stale          (writers only) its last full verification is older than FULL_VERIFY_S; or a
                 checkpointed run is missing from the store, which fails visibly as corrupt history
                 (a full replay alone could not notice that a run had disappeared)

Only writers (collect_once, enrich_pending, `checkpoint rebuild`) save it, under the writer lease.
Readers (views, indexes, query, join) use it read-only and never write.

Bounded listing (the frontier). Raw runs are immutable and never pruned, so listing all of
news/v1/runs/ on every read would grow without bound. The head records a frontier: the last run
prefix (in key order) such that every run prefix at or before it was settled and is in the body.
Reads list only the keys after the frontier (ListObjectsV2 StartAfter) and take the runs at or before
it from the body. Three tiers keep this correct:

  every read      list after the frontier; runs at or before it come from the body. A run that is
                  not settled (uncommitted, availability pending, corrupt) is never passed by the
                  frontier, so it is always listed and re-read until it settles.
  every FULL_VERIFY_S (writers)
                  list all of news/v1/runs/ and compare every run's listing tags (size, ETag) with the
                  body: a changed run is re-read and verified, a missing one fails visibly. This is
                  listings only (no blanket object reads), so it does not grow into a content replay.
  full replay     reading every object again only when the checkpoint is missing, corrupt or
                  incompatible, when disabled, and for `checkpoint rebuild` / `compare`.

A writer that is about to upload a run whose prefix is at or before the frontier (a spool recovered
under its original, older run_id, or a clock that went backwards) first clears the frontier durably
(guard_frontier), before any upload. A crash after that upload cannot hide the run: the next read has
no frontier and lists everything, and the next save sets a new frontier from that full listing.
A change to a run at or before the frontier (an object rewritten or deleted outside the writer) is
detected at the next full listing, at most FULL_VERIFY_S later, not on every read.

"""Publish sanitized news views (M5 local preparation; G3 generations; G6 settlement): private -> public.

Two stores, never the same one:

  private   the raw archive (news/v1/runs/, indexes, latest.json, writer lease)
            plus the publisher's own state under news/v1/publish/:
              head.json                   THE shared record, changed only by compare-and-swap: live commit,
                                          incarnations (pinned / retiring, their reserved pages and
                                          lifecycle events), prepared commits, high-water marks, withdrawing
              commits/<nonce>.json        one durable record per index write, written before it is sent
              state.json                  informational: clock high-water marks, last failure, blocked /
                                          paused notes, a summary of what is live (no decision reads it)
              heartbeat.json              rewritten every run; its store modification time is the store clock
              stop.json                   operator stop marker (cycles and publication no-op)
              lease.json                  single-publisher lease (avoids wasted work; safety is the head)
              snapshots/<gen>/...         the exact unqualified build of recent generations (restore)
              receipts/<time>-<gen>.json  one per publication / restore / reseal / withdrawal
  public    only the exact view keys the panel and proxy accept (fresh namespaces, G6):
              news/v2/views/index.json                                                the commit point
              news/v2/views/p/<gen>.<n>/<mode>/<stream>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/page-NNNN.json  immutable
            Legacy keys (news/v1/views/index.json, news/v1/views/g/...) are never read, written or deleted.

Settlement (the accepted G5 design and its lifecycle addendum):

  - Every index write is a compare-and-swap on the ETag of the index it replaces (the first one is
    create-only), sent once, with a fresh 128-bit nonce in its body, so no two index bodies are equal.
  - Durable intent comes first: the commit record, then the commit in the head, then the index write.
  - Outcomes are explicit. 412 is a known rejection. Anything else is ambiguous: the commit stays open
    in the head. It can land only while the index it was conditioned on is live; any later landed write
    ends that. No timer, no retry and no operator note settles it; observation does.
  - Landed evidence and cessation are separate. A generation ceases only when a later full observation
    finds a different committed incarnation, or a tombstone, live; the stamp is a clock reading taken
    after that observation, never a commit's preparation time.
  - A page namespace (incarnation <gen>.<n>) in which a delete has been started is never written again.
    Restore and republication reuse a still-pinned incarnation or take <gen>.<n+1>; without a snapshot
    the restore is refused.
  - The index key is never deleted. Withdrawal writes a tombstone over it and deletes every page at once;
    it is unconfirmed until a tombstone is read back live.
  - Admission, commit preparation, cleanup and withdrawal each change the head before touching the
    public store, so a pin and a retirement of the same incarnation cannot both win, and the page cap
    is reserved in the same compare-and-swap that pins.

Each run: read the clock and the head; observe the live index in full (index bytes, commit nonce, every
page hash) and record what that proves; clean up (mark orphan/expired incarnations retiring, delete
their pages, record empties); pin an incarnation within the cap; record the page-upload attempt in the
head; write its pages create-if-absent; record that every upload was answered; prepare the commit; send
the index; observe again. An incarnation with an upload attempt that was never answered is quarantined:
a page PUT may still land, so it keeps its head entry and full reservation and is never released (no
listing, elapsed time, process exit or tombstone counts as settlement; there is no in-code release).

PROVIDER / SDK ASSUMPTIONS (documented or assumed in archive.py; none verified by this module): atomic
conditional PutObject, 412 on a failed condition, one request per call on the no-retry client, a returned
ETag, distinct bodies never sharing an ETag, and the same behaviour on the private store.
Nothing here contacts a network or a bucket unless a caller passes such a store.

    2. A tombstone is written over the index by compare-and-swap. The key is never deleted. A 412
       means a prepared commit landed first: the index is read again and the next tombstone is
       conditioned on it (at most WITHDRAW_ROUNDS attempts, each with a recorded result).
    3. Every public page is deleted at once, whatever the tombstone's outcome.
    4. The withdrawal is confirmed only when a tombstone is read back live. Until then the result and
       `publish-status` say withdrawal_unconfirmed, and the public index may be the old index or an
       index from a commit prepared earlier that lands late; either names pages that no longer
       exist (readers see "refresh required"). That interval has no time bound: it ends when a
       tombstone is confirmed. Run withdraw again to send another tombstone.
    5. An incarnation with an unanswered page upload keeps its head entry and full reservation after
       its pages are deleted: a PUT sent before the withdrawal may land after it, and the page then
       reappears (named by no index). The tombstone confirms the index only. `uploads_unsettled`
       lists them; every later withdraw or cleanup run deletes what lands. No time bound either.
